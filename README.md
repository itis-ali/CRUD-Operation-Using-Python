# CRUD-Operation-Using-Python
This is a multi-layered Python-based program which performs the CRUD operation.
This project is implemented on PUBS database by Microsoft using tkinter and customtkinter packages.
In order to be able to execute this project user needs to restore the database .bak file.
Necessary changes are also supposed to be done on the configuration.ini file to address the database on user's system.
Initial username and password is accessible in a column named Users.dbo in the database.
